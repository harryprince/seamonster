Title: U.S. ZIP Code database for geocoding
Description: This package contains a database of city, state, latitude,
    and longitude information for U.S. ZIP codes from the CivicSpace
    Database (August 2004) augmented by Daniel Coven's
    federalgovernmentzipcodes.us web site (updated January 22, 2012).
    Previous versions of this package (before 1.0) were based solely on
    the CivicSpace data, so an original version of the CivicSpace
    database is also included.
